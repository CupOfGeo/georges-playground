Hello this is a test repo that I have configured with pre-commit-hooks and GitHub actions.

I have a my-python-app module that doesn't do much, but it has tests and docker container. \
run tests with `pytest my_python_app/tests`

#### Questions I'm having right now

- Not sure what to do with workflow/actions/lint just added pre-commit hooks to test workflow.
I know I saw Nerash had an actual pipeline curious what was going on there. I guess its multiple jobs in the work flow.
