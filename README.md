Hello this is a test repo that I have configured with pre-commit-hooks and GitHub actions.

I have a my-python-app module that doesn't do much, but it has tests and docker container. \
run tests with `pytest my_python_app/tests`

#### Questions I'm having right now

- I have two files in my workflow right now lint and tests. Is this correct
